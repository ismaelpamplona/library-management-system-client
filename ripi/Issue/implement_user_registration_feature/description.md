  - [x] Implement the form in the `RegisterUser.tsx` component.

  - [ ] Write a test that simulates form submission and checks if the form values are correctly captured.
  - [ ] Run the test to confirm it fails.
  - [ ] Implement form submission logic and ensure the test passes.
- [ ] Integrate API call for user registration:
  - [ ] Write a test that mocks an API call to register a new user.
